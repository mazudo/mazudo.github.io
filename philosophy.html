        <h1>Teaching Philosophy Statement - Sudo sensei</h1>
        <blockquote>“
            <em><strong>People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel</strong></em>” – Maya Angelou</blockquote>
        <p>The core to my teaching philosophy is heart. I care about each of my students and want them to become the best version of themselves emotionally and academically. As a teacher I strive to make that connection with their heart. If I can unlock
            that and trust is established, it opens the door to so many possibilities. Students will <strong>feel safe</strong> in my classroom to be themselves and celebrate inevitable failures as they learn new concepts. Students will <strong>feel
            excitement</strong> and be intrinsically motivated to learn when they work on open-ended assignments that allow them to pursue a subject-area that ignites their passions. Students will <strong>feel pride</strong> when they discover they can
            take a core concept taught in class and apply it to create something original. </p>
        <p>When students enter my classroom, they will get to know a teacher who isn’t afraid to be himself and celebrates failure by modeling it. He will ask them to address him as Sudo sensei to celebrate his Japanese heritage and will play Ukulele from
            time to time even though his singing is terrible. He will have a vested interest in their academic progress throughout the course, but will also ask them about their pet peeves, weirdest food they have ever eaten, etc. because he genuinely
            wants to get to know them. </p>
        <blockquote>“<em><strong>Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think</strong></em>” (Einstein, 1879 - 1955)</blockquote>
        <p>
            We do an injustice to our students if we ask them to memorize facts and regurgitate them back to us. Frankly, that is what the internet is for, and it does it better than any human can. While there may be a place for fact memorization, I do not believe
            it is learning. Learning happens when we get the student to think critically. Learning happens when we teach the student a concept and he/she/they can think and apply it in a different context, or better yet extend it (e.g., If 1+1=2, what
            is 1+3? What is the quickest way to solve 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9?) When a student thinks critically, he/she/they is forced to internalize the concept and merge it into their existing understanding of the world.
        </p>
        <p>My students will learn how to think critically by using the
            <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking">Stanford d-school Design Thinking Process</a> to turn their ideas into a product that solves real-world problems. Through my 18-year career at Microsoft
            this is one of the most effective methodologies I’ve seen applied in the industry. I want my students to learn this process, so they too can turn their ideas into a working solution. Major project assignments in my classes are project-based
            and will guide students through the 5 phases of the Design Thinking Process: (1) empathize, (2) define, (3) ideate, (4) prototype, and (5) test, to build a final culminating product.</p>

        <h2>End of trimester course evaluation questions</h2>
        <p>I will ask my students to evaluate me on how well I am practicing my teaching philosophy</p>
