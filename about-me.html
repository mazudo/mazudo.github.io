                <p>Masato Sudo (a.k.a. Sudo Sensei by his students), is a computer science teacher at <a
                        href="https://www.eastsideprep.org" target="_blank"> Eastside
                        Preparatory School</a> (EPS), considered one of the
                    <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/eastside-preparatory-school-kirkland-wa/" target="_blank">top
                        independent schools
                    </a> in Washington state. He mainly teaches 9th-12th grade students and
                    sometimes substitute teaches middle school
                    students. He teaches
                    and designs high school curriculum in programming, web design, Arduino and sensor hardware, and
                    internet-of-things.
                </p>
                <p>Two quotes that best capture Masato's teaching style are:</p>
                <blockquote>“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will
                    forget what you did, but
                    people will never forget how
                    you made them feel.”
                    ― Maya Angelou</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.” - Plutarch</blockquote>


                <p>Prior to EPS, Masato Sudo double majored in Computer Science and Psychology at <a
                        href="https://www.williams.edu/" target="_blank">Williams College</a> and
                    worked at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> for 18 years. His
                    double major
                    reflects his passion in technology and education
                    that has not changed till this day. At Microsoft, he was a software engineer, manager, and
                    data engineer. He worked on embedded and phone operating systems, internet-of-things prototypes, and
                    the Windows OS core networking stack. Masato also
                    volunteered as a STEM teacher at local schools, where he helped middle and high school students
                    successfully build and
                    launch a Lego Mindstorm science experiment into space on the International Space Station!</p>
                <p>
                    Masato firmly believes that coding is an essential 21st century skill for our future generation. It
                    is a super-power
                    that enables us to create whatever we put our mind to. It is an incredible tool that goes beyond the
                    screen to help make progress in pressing global issues such as climate change and world hunger. </p>

                <p>He can’t wait to share his passion with even more of our future generation through his tutoring
                    business,
                    Sudo Sensei Labs. He is grateful for the opportunity and hope you will give him the chance to get to
                    know
                    and help your child reach their full potential.</p>
